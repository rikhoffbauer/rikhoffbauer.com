## Lyrics

```
7 in the morning, cigarette, see the sun rise,
just climbed out the bed,
ready for the day,
fold my hands and pray
clean my teeth, take shower and im on my way,
reflect hate like my ray ban shades,
live life served on a silver plate
operate dont participate
live till you evaporate
```

> chapter of revelations: earth will catch fire

```

don't speculate
you got only got one life to throw away
so dont make it waste
```

> dont expect earth to catch fire just make the best out of life

```
be yourself
so don't copy paste
haste leave space for sloppy ways,
they say i waste time with my coffee breaks,
```

> coffee breaks living life slowly and easily are the most important things
> but often referred to as something for the lazy and unimportant

```
better stay in line or face the mace,
```

> dont do stuff that isn't allowed or be prepared to get a mace to the face

```
enslaved by wages,
```

> we have to work to survive

```
underpaid,
```

> a lot of money WE earned gets stolen by collection agencies like the IRS

```
we gotta break free,
destroy the cage,
```

> think 'cage' most people are in

```
okay, shit, sorry for the rage,
i waited, for some better days,
ama-zing like like the pearly gates,
```

> pearly gates = heaven

```
but they seem sealed shut like a safe,
no way out, no way in,
control the mass, destroying em
atom blasts, deploying em,
trading blood for oil again,
```

--------------------------
`[George Bush Sr. speech]`

--------------------------

```
hush hush,
go to sleep,
armed forces flood iraqi streets,
fighting evil to keep you free,
moms and kids crying on their knees,
daddy left us rest in peace
The sky was lit like new years eve,
```

> not fireworks but bombs light the sky

```
atom splits, left dead bodies,
```

> atom splits: atomic bombs are based on splitting atoms to produce energy

```
burnt limbs 3rd or 4th degree,
```

> heavily burned or incinerated

```
tvs deceive the sheep with ease,
```

> most people believe what they see on TV just because it was on TV

```
they make us fall for fallacies,
```

> make us believe their lies

```
they amplify insanity,
projecting fake reality
```

> the stuff they tell us isn't whats actually happening but rather a fake reality of this world

--------------------------
`[charlie chaplin speech]`

--------------------------

```
so who brought us here?
four years ago, false promises he said hope and not fear,
```

> Obama's campaign keywords were change and hope

```
status quo though so most people cheer,
```

> all presidents are like that

```
unaware that the beast is near red-shields affair
```

> red-shields=Rothschilds

```
and police don't care, like,
fuck a hooker bare got STDs to share,
```

> iemand die sex heeft met een hoer zonder condoom 'cared' vrij weinig (om SOAs (STDs))
